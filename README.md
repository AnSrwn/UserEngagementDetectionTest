## Setup
The easiest way to setup the environment is by using Anaconda and one of the provided environment files (only Linux is tested so far).

Then start the app with `python main.py` and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

The perfomance is not optimized yet, so it will stutter.
